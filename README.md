# nrf_utils

This repo is providing various tools and utilities to: 
* `code`: manage Firmware through code formating, easy version handling and other tools for compilation
* `debug`: Make Firmware debugging fast and accessible 
* `deploy`: Make CI/CD and deployment easier

Note: Python scripts are compatible with Python 3.7+.

## Installation and usage

### Conda

A Conda environment file is provided: 

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Code

### CMake

CMake makes compilation faster and CLion has a great support which makes a great build system generator.

### Format

I'm a big fan of clang-format. You'll find my customized formating file
in [code/format/.clang-format](code/format/.clang-format). That file can be used directly in your editor. More
info [here](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).

You won't have any excuse for bad formating!

### Version

ðŸ‘‰ Check-out [my article](http://www.cyrilfougeray.com/2021/01/25/recipe-automated-versioning.html) explaining the role
of each file and how to setup an automated process for versioning.

[SemVer](https://semver.org/) is a great way to define how versions are handled into your project. That how I'm used to
track versions for the Application.

Versioning is better when automated. I've been using a file called `version.ini`, located at the root of the project
containing both the Application and the Bootloader to track version in that manner:

	* `Major.Minor.Patch`, same as SemVer, for Application version.
		* `Major` increased between each major version that are not backward compatible for the end user: API update, new bootloader breaking stuff between the two versions, new SoftDevice or SDK version for example.
		* `Minor` increased between each Production release.
		* `Patch` increased between new DFU packages ready to be tested (Staging or Preprod stages).
	* `Version`, using one number, for Bootloader version.
	* `Version`, using one number, for Hardware version.

I've setup a script to write that version into `version.ini`, and two `version.h` files for both your Application and
Bootloader projects.

```
# Setup version = 1.2.3
$ python gen_version.py -f path/to/version.ini -i path/to/version.h" -v 1.2.3

# Increment patch: version will be 1.2.4
$ python gen_version.py -f path/to/version.ini -i path/to/version.h" -p

# Increment minor: version will be 1.3.0
$ python gen_version.py -f path/to/version.ini -i path/to/version.h" -m
```

...Note: In order to go further, you must ensure that a build is uniquely identified, [read that article from Memfault for more information](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-build-id-for-firmware).

## Debug

Checkout [my article](https://www.cyrilfougeray.com/2020/07/27/firmware-logs-with-stack-trace.html) explaining how to implement the debugging tools.

You will find a log generator ([target side](debug/log/trace.h)) and parser ([Python client](debug/log/uart_dump.py)) to make your logs beautiful and convenient. You will also be able to print stack trace directly from the client if you implement [CrashCatcher](https://github.com/adamgreen/CrashCatcher) on your target. You can use [crash_hexdump.c](debug/log/crash_hexdump.c) as an example to implement CrashCatcher.
